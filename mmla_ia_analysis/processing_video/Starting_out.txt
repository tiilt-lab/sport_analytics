Start by downloading this link to your computer: https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models 

I updated the tfjs-models/pose-detection/demos/upload_video/src/index.js file to the one on this github. 

To run the model on the data: 

If you want to run any of the demos locally, follow these steps:

Go to the demo folder, e.g. `cd upload_video`

Remove cache etc. `rm -rf .cache dist node_modules`

Build dependency. `yarn build-dep`

Install dependencies. `yarn`

Run the demo. `yarn watch`

The demo runs at localhost:1234. (Remember to provide URL model parameter e. g. localhost:1234/?model=movenet)

It will produce a json of 851 rows, which you can update in the index.js file.
